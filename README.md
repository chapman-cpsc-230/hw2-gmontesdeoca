**Author:** Gabi Montes De Oca

**Due date:** 4 March 2016

## Description
Creating two different programs, one which queries for two different numbers and produces a sum of powers, and one that uses Newton's Law of Cooling to produce a table of values showing the time and temperature.


## What I Learned from This
I learned how to use a while loop to compute a program and how to ask the program user to input a value. I also learned how to create a table of values in a program. 


## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
